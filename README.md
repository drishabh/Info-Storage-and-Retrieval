# Info-Storage-and-Retrieval

1. boolean-retrieval ... Implementation of boolean retrieval system using inverted indexing. The system only supports conjunctive queries,
                         although it also contains the code for disjunctive queries for text file. There are three other documents attached
                         to test it upon namely document1.txt, document2.txt, document3.txt. Posting lists are saved as linked lists, which
                         in themselves are values whose keys are tokens hashed using a dictionary. It does multiple conjuctions in a
                         way to minimize run-time by processing the boolean queries in increasing order of frequencies of the tokens.
                         
2. linkedList ... Contains the Node class and Linked list class to facilitate in making posting lists.
