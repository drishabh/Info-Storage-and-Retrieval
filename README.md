# Info-Storage-and-Retrieval

1. boolean-retrieval ... Implementation of boolean retrieval system using inverted indexing. The system only supports conjunctive queries, although it also contains the code for disjunctive queries for text file. There are three other documents attached to test it upon namely document1.txt, document2.txt, document3.txt. Posting lists are saved as linked lists, which in themselves are values whose keys are tokens hashed using a dictionary. It does multiple conjuctions in a way to minimize run-time by processing the boolean queries in increasing order of frequencies of the tokens.
                         
2. linkedList ... Contains the Node class, Skipped Node class that inherits from Node class and Linked list class to facilitate in making posting lists. Skipped Node class facilitates in creating posting lists that contains skip pointer for finding faster posting lists intersection.
                
3. skippedList.py ... Contains the implementation of posting lists containing skip pointers and class SkippedList, which inherits from linked list and gives each node the extra skip pointer for finding posting list intersection faster. For a posting list of length P, âˆšP evenly spaced skip pointers are used. It also contains various other functions for finding the intersection of posting lists using skip pointers and for changing a simple posting list to have skip pointers. 

4. Tile.java ... A helper class for the Edit_Distance class. Each tile mainly consists of a number gotten by applying Levenshtein's algorithm at that particular time in the program and the possible paths/tile (up, left, left diagonal) from which it can trace back to. {If it is difficult to understand, read 5 first.}

5. Edit_Distance.java ... Levenshtein's algorithm to quantify how different two strings are. Replacement, Insertion and deletion of character are considered as basic operations each having the same overhead. The algorithm uses dynamic programming and it has run-time of O(n.m). It asks for two input strings from console and returns the edit distance. It can also print the steps to change one string into another and the intermediate table formed while solving.

6. proximity-search.py ... Implementation of phrase queries using posting lists having positional indexes. Preprocessing includes creating the posting lists. The structure of the posting lists is: each posting list is a value to a given key stored in a "dictionary". Each posting list is a 2D list, whose each element is a list containing the document number in which the key occurs at index 0 and linked list containing the indices at which the key occurs in that particular document. Case of the letters and other symbols (,./"-$ ...) are neglected. The program processes all the text documents located in the same folder as the program.
